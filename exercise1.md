My choice for a programming language in this exercise is Python. In Python environment popular tools for linting are PyLint and mypy. For testing Python code there seems to be a lot of alternatives. Some of them are PyTest and PyUnit, which is built in unit testing tool that is inspired by Javas JUnit. Robot Framework was also mentioned in many Google answers, although i think it is not just Python testing tool but more general acceptance testing framework. Build tools for Python included PyBuilder, Bitbake and buildout. Besides Jenkins and Github Actions there are various CI/CD tools on the market such as GitLab and Azure Devops other options are for example Travis CI and Circle CI. The example project would be moderately small. There are 6 people in the team so it could be like a school project for example. Considering the small size of the project team, the nature of the project and the things I have read so far in this course module, I would be leaning towards cloud-based solution. That would probably be simpler and more cost-efficient solution for this project. GitLab for example seems to be quite popular cloud-based solution in addition to GitHub. They both seem to have same sort of features for CI/CD so probably that would be good choice for small scale school- or other recreational project.
